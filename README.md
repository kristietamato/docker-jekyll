# docker-jekyll

A development environment for Jekyll which solely relies on Docker to separate
system dependencies.

# Requirements

* Docker

Optionally, `make` makes it easy.  Otherwise, if you do not wish to use `make`
then reference the [`Makefile`](Makefile) for running commands.

# Getting started (first time)

1. Fork this repository.
2. Execute `make` to start an initial docker image with a minimal jekyll
   installation.
3. Initialize your first Jekyll website.
